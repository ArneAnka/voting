# Laravel PHP Framework Simple Databse with voting and comments
Trying to build a NES and SNES comment and voting system. But cant really get things to work.. :(

# Problems
1. Up and down votes doesn't appear under Title.
2. When commenting, with validation error, errors appear on all divs.
3. Total amount of comments for a Title doesn't appear.
4. "/l" route shouldent exist. When just hitting "/m", all games should appear
5. Searching when browsing comments should go to "/l/all" (or /m/all)
6. Be able to vote up and down on comments.
7. clean up a VoteTrait
